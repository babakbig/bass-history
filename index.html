                <h1>The unsung heroes</h1>

                <p> Did you know that the bassist is the most important member of a band? Here is why. Studies show that the human brain finds it easier to understand and find the 
                    rhythm in a song when it is played at a lower register, such as a bass. It's the bass that bridges the gap between treble (guitar) and percussion (drums), 
                    providing a rhythmic and harmonic function at the same time. But since most bands have a strong mix of mid-to-high instruments and vocals 
                    which get all the attention from the listener's ear, the bass gets a lot less time in the spotlight. 
                </p>

                <h1>A brief history of electric bass</h1>

                <p> Until 60 years ago, the low frequency range in live music was still reserved for the double bass. In jazz, swing, blues, and later also in rock ‘n’ roll, 
                    the bands became louder because, suddenly, drums and electric guitars were integrated into popular music. And in this thunderstorm you had to be able to keep up 
                    as a bass player. A double bass cannot deliver such volume due to its construction, so the electric bass stepped in, assertively, and took its place.
                    Another issue was the 'logistical problem' of the double bass due to its size and weight. The club and live scene became highly active and music was being played on 
                    every corner and as such, bass players needed an instrument with easier mobility.
                     
                </p>
                

            </div>
 
            <div class="overflow">
                <p> Don’t forget that music was rapidly changing and with it the demands of the bass lines. A correct intonation especially for faster passages was difficult to achieve. 
                    A double bass does not have frets for orienting oneself, but even here a sensible solution was obvious. The experience with fretted string instruments was, 
                    after all, already available on guitars – both acoustic and electric. So why not combine the concepts of guitars and double bass?
