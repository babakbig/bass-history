                    <p>Lloyd Loar makes an experimental prototype electric bass for Gibson, but neither the management nor the public accepts it. Lloyd resigns from Gibson the same year.

                    <p>One of the first modern electric bass guitars--perhaps the first one (if you don't count Lloyd Loar's rejected prototype)--is produced in 
                        Seattle, Washington by the Audiovox Manufacturing Company. Created by <strong>Paul Tutmarc</strong>, the electric upright solid body bass, 
                        much smaller than the acoustic version, is marketed as the "Electric Bass Fiddle." Released in 1935, the device is two feet shorter than the 
                        usual stand-up bass and easier to carry.</p>

                    <p><strong>Leo Fender</strong> releases the Fender Precision Bass, the first compact, easily portable modern day electric bass guitar that can be 
                        played like an electric six-string guitar, and it is paired with a new Fender amp designed for the bass. The bass has a single coil pickup, 
                        and it is basic compared to later models, but its tiny size is a revolution for bass players.</p>

                    <p>Gibson releases the EB-2, which puts Gibson on the map as a serious bass guitar maker in addition to its electric guitar legacy. It features 
                        an innovative baritone button, which allows bassists to press a button to switch between a deep rumble and a less bassy, more midrange bass 
                        tone.</p>

                    <p>1960: Fender releases the Fender Jazz Bass, which becomes popular with jazz bassists. This model has two single coil pick-ups and a narrower nut.
                         After the invention of the Fender Jazz Bass, bass lingo has developed to refer to the pickups on the precision bass as "P" pickups and the 
                         pickups on the jazz bass as "J" pickups.</p>

                    <p>Rickenbacker releases its 4001 model of electric bass guitar, which is made famous when it becomes the bass of choice for Paul McCartney of 
                        The Beatles. Besides making the instrument a household name in popular culture, McCartney's use of it leads other artists to use 
                        Rickenbacker's instruments.</p>

                    <p>James Brown and other artists like Sly and the Family Stone and George Clinton introduce funk music to the popular consciousness, which 
                        forever changes the role of the bass guitar, making it the centerpiece and leading to the development of slap bass and the bass-driven 
                        genres, such as disco, techno, hip-hop, rap, and today's EDM.</p>

                    <p>Further tweaks are made to the bass guitar in the 1970s. This period saw the creation of high-end bass guitars by Alembic. Custom made 
                        and using premium materials, their guitars are made for the professional. They also come in four-string and five-string versions, as well as a low-tuned, 
                        six-string version.</p>

                    <p>Gibson becomes a prominent brand name for bassists in the alternative rock era when Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic uses Gibson RD bass guitars 
                        for the landmark album Nevermind.</p>
